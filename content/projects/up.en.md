# Guide

## 1. Basic

A task is something you need to do, or something you want to make a habit of doing.

In Up, you can create multiple missions to earn exp.

> 💡Tip: add emojis to mission names to customize them

The more specific the mission, the better!

(for e.g.)
- Running → Run **5km**

## 2. Fulfill your mission

You can complete a mission by **pressing and holding an item in the mission list**.

Each day you complete a mission increases the amount of exp you receive as a streak reward. (You can check your streaks by looking at the badge in the mission list)

However, there are **some limitations**, including

- You can only perform each mission once per day.
- The maximum amount of exp you can get from a streak is 7.
    - When you're on a 3-day streak, you'll receive 4 exp for completing missions (base 1 + streak bonus 3).
    - When you're on a 12-day streak, you'll earn 7 exp for completing missions (max 7)
